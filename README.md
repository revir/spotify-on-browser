# Spotify on Browser

![screenshot](readme_images/s1.jpg)

Spotify has a really cool feature called **Spotify Connect**. Basically it could turn anything into a Spotify player, and control it with your cellphone. I made this app trying to connect Spotify with your browsers. So why use this player instead of Spotify website?

   1. Play in background of browsers, no need to keep Spotify's tab open;
   2. Global keyboard shortcut to play/stop/next/previous/save;
   3. Transfer playback to this player seamlessly with just one click.

After install it from the web store, use it in the following steps:

1. **Authorize** on Spotify;
2. Choose music on Spotify and play it on **"Spotify on Browser"**. If you have a premium account on Spotify, you can seamlessly transfer your playback to this player, with just one click on the play button.

# Build

1. use `yarn` or `npm install` to install requirements.
2. `npm start` to start a webpack dev-server, add the `build/` directory in your browser's extension page to load the extension.
3. `npm run build` to build the release code. The dest path is `build/`.

# Privacy Policy

This app uses Spotify's API, so it needs you to authorize on Spotify. It doesn't collect any information about your Spotify account or any other websites. It doesn't sell any of your data either.
Besides, it's open-source.
